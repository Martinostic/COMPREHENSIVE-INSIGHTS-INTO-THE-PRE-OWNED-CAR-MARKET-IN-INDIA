For instance, in Hyderabad, highlight the durability and mileage of cars to appeal to a highly mobile population that values long-lasting and efficient vehicles. Meanwhile, in Delhi, focus on promoting affordability and budget-friendly options to attract cost-conscious buyers looking for the best value

5  5. Focus on a car’s condition and features when selling high-mileage vehicles.
